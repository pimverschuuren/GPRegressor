# GPRegressor
This repository contains a python class of which the instantiated objects can apply Gaussian Process regression. The mathematical framework behind the code is largely based on C. E. Rasmussen & C. K. I. Williams, Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning. Some example scripts are included to illustrate the use of this class and the dynamics of GP regression in general.
